                In partnership with Give Kids the World, students will serve and support families with children suffering from 
                life-threatening illnesses who are enjoying their Make-a-Wish trip to Disney World. After our days of service, 
                we will have fun at Epcot and the Magic Kingdom.

                Service-learning travel challenges you to get out of your comfort zone, experience a different part of the country, 
                personally grow and reflect, and make a significant difference for others. And, you will have a great time doing it 
                with friends - old and new! 
                
                We are confident that this trip will challenge you to learn and grow as a person while you also serve families at 
                Give Kids the World Village.
